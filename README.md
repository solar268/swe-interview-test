# SWE INTERVIEW TEST - COMPLETED PROJECT

This repository contains my completed solution for the Software Engineering (SWE) test provided by A Round Entertainment. The project showcases my ability to meet the app development requirements outlined in the assignment.

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application featuring a simple card list with product information. It includes both a backend API and a frontend interface, designed and implemented according to the specifications provided in the test.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

## Setup and Running the Application

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory: cd StarterCode/backend

2. Install dependencies: npm install

3. Start the backend server: node index.js

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory: cd StarterCode/frontend

2. Install dependencies: npm install

3. Start the frontend server: npm start

## Using the Application

- The homepage displays a list of products in a card format.
- Each card shows the product's name, description, price, and image.
- To delete a product, click the delete icon in the top-left corner of the product card.

## Notes

- Ensure that both the backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously to interact with the application.
- If you encounter any issues starting the backend or frontend, verify that all dependencies are installed and the correct versions of Node.js and npm are used.
